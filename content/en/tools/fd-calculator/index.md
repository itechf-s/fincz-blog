## FD Calculator


{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a FD calculator?
The fixed deposit (FD) calculator will help you calculate the maturity value of the investment if it grows at a certain interest rate.


## How to use it

The maturity value of the deposit will depend on the amount of investment, duration of the deposit, interest rate, and on the frequency of interest pay-out which can be monthly or quarterly, or a cumulative deposit.

You will have to enter the date of opening of the FD, and then enter the amount of deposit which has to between Rs 500 and Rs 10 lakh. Thereafter, choose the frequency of the interest pay-out. For monthly and quarterly pay-outs, reinvestment, the duration has to be entered in days, months or years. The short term duration can be between 1-31 days.

Lastly, enter the annual rate of interest at which the fixed deposit investment has been made.

One can use the slider to put in different fixed deposit amounts to arrive at the final maturity value.
