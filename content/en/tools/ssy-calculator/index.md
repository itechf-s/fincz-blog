## SSY Calculator


{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a SSY calculator?
Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana or SSY account is a Government of India-backed small deposit scheme for a girl child. The SSY account is opened anytime after the birth of the girl child until she turns 10 years old. You may open the SSY account at the post office or any branch of a commercial bank. You may open the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana account with a minimum initial deposit of just Rs 250. 

## How does SSY Calculator work?
You must enter the amount of deposit, the age of the girl child, and the year in which you start the investment. The SSY calculator will show you the interest earned on the investment and the maturity amount. Let us use the mathematical formula: A = P(1+r/n)^nt P = Initial Deposit r = Rate of interest n = Number of years the interest compounds t = Number of years A = Amount at maturity For example, you deposit Rs 1,50,000 each year for 15 years in the SSY account.
