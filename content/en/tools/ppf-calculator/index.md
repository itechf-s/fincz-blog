## How PPF Interest is Calculated?

Those who are wondering how the PPF interest is calculated must know that the PPF interest is calculated on the minimum PPF account balance of an individual deposited between the 5th and last day of every month. With this comes several facts to consider. Such as-

If you are willing to make a fresh deposit, you need to get it done before the 5th  of each month to get interest on that deposit for that month. In cases otherwise, the interest will be calculated on the previous balance, and the new deposit will not be considered.
