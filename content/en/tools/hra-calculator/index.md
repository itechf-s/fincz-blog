{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a HRA calculator?

House Rent Allowance (HRA) is a component of a taxpayerâ€™s salary that reduces his/her tax liability, provided he/she stays in rented accommodation. It is possible to calculate the amount of HRA that will be exempt from tax using online HRA Exemption Calculators. It can also be calculated manually.

## How HRA is calculated in salary?

HRA received from your employer. Actual rent paid minus 10% of salary. 50% of basic salary for those living in metro cities. 40% of basic salary for those living in non-metro cities.

## What are the HRA rules?

HRA Exemption Rule
The actual rent paid minus 10% of the basic salary + DA (Dearness Allowance)
In case an employee is staying in a metro city, 50% of the basic salary and 40% if he lives in a non-metro city.
The total amount received as HRA from the employer.

## How to claim the benefit

To avoid excess TDS from being deducted from your salary, you will have to provide rent agreement and/or rent receipts to your employer. If your annual rent payment is more than Rs 1 lakh, then you will provide your landlord's PAN, as well, to your employer.

However, even if you have forgotten to submit rent receipts/rent agreement to your employer, then you can claim the benefit at the time of filing of income tax returns.

It is advisable to keep proofs of rent paid and rent receipts as the tax department can ask you to provide it to authenticate your claim.

## What is the minimum HRA?

HRA is mainly determined by your salary. As per the income tax rules, the tax-exempt part of the HRA (House Rent Allowance) is the minimum of the following amounts: Actual HRA component of salary. 50% of basic salary if he resides in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, or Mumbai; 40% if his residence is in any other city.

## HRA Calculation with Example

The salary of both public and private sector employees is composed of several parts and allocated towards different expenses. HRA is one such component. 

The HRA may be fixed or derived through an exclusive agreement between you and your employer.  

The HRA exemption of tax is covered under Income Tax Act Section 10-13A and provides for the HRA deduction based on the amount lowest amongst these: 

- The actual amount of HRA given by the employer

- 50% of your salary is eligible for the HRA exemption if you live in a Metro city of India

- 40% of your salary is HRA exempted if you live in a non-metro city 

- Actual rent paid each month, minus 10 % of your salary (salary here means the basic salary, including the commissions and dearness allowance) 

## Calculation of tax-exempt HRA amount

The amount of HRA received by you from your employer is not fully exempt from tax. The tax-exempt portion of the HRA is actually the minimum of the following:
a) Actual HRA received from employer

b) 50 percent of the 'salary' if the accommodation is in the metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata) or else 40 percent for other cities
c) Excess rent paid annually over 10 percent of the annual 'salary'

Here 'salary' means basic salary, dearness allowance (DA) (if it forms part of the retirement benefit) and commission received on the basis of percentage of turnover.

No other allowances like special allowance are added into to your salary for computing the tax-exempted HRA amount.

## How is maximum HRA exemption calculated?
1. Actual HRA received from employer.

2. For those living in metro cities: 50% of (Basic salary + Dearness allowance) For those living in non-metro cities: 40% of (Basic salary + Dearness allowance)

3. Actual rent paid minus 10% of (Basic salary + Dearness allowance)

## Which of the following allowance is fully exempted?

Certain categories of taxes are fully exempted such as allowances given to judges at the Supreme Court and the High Courts. 

Allowances such as house rent allowance are partially exempted as per Section 10(13A). Other allowances such as city compensatory allowance are fully taxable.
