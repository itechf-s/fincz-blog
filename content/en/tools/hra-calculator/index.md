## HRA Calculator


{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a HRA calculator?
House rent allowance (HRA) is a basic component of your salary. However, most of us are not familiar about the rules that can help us save tax on it. If you are a salaried employee living on rent, then here's how you can use HRA to reduce your tax liability.


## How to claim the benefit ?

To avoid excess TDS from being deducted from your salary, you will have to provide rent agreement and/or rent receipts to your employer. If your annual rent payment is more than Rs 1 lakh, then you will provide your landlord's PAN, as well, to your employer.

However, even if you have forgotten to submit rent receipts/rent agreement to your employer, then you can claim the benefit at the time of filing of income tax returns. It is advisable to keep proofs of rent paid and rent receipts as the tax department can ask you to provide it to authenticate your claim.
