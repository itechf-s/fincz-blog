## EPF Calculator


{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a EPF calculator?
The Employee Provident Fund or the EPF is a retirement benefits scheme for salaried employees in the private sector. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) manages the EPF. Any organisation or firm with 20 or more employees gets covered under the EPFO. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation operates three schemes.


## How does an EPF calculator work?

To understand how the EPF calculator works, let us have an example.

Employees basic salary + dearness allowance = Rs 14,000
Employees contribution towards the EPF = 12% * 14,000 = Rs 1,680
Employers contribution towards the EPF = 3.67% * 14,000 = Rs 514
Employers contribution towards EPS = 8.33% * 14,000 = Rs 1,166.
