## EPF Calculator


{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a EPF calculator?
The Employee Provident Fund or the EPF is a retirement benefits scheme for salaried employees in the private sector. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) manages the EPF. Any organisation or firm with 20 or more employees gets covered under the EPFO. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation operates three schemes.

## What is Employee Pension Scheme (EPS)?
In this fund the employer and the Central Government contribute a defined amount every month with the sole objective of providing regular pension to the employee post retirement. 

You as an employee do not contribute to your own Pension Scheme, this is contributed by your employer and by the Central Government. 

Your employer contributes 8.33% of Rs. 6,500 Basic salary to the Employee Pension Scheme, and the Central Government contributes 1.16% of the same. The EPS provides you with regular annuity after your retirement.

## How does an EPF calculator work?

To understand how the EPF calculator works, let us have an example.

Employees basic salary + dearness allowance = Rs 14,000
Employees contribution towards the EPF = 12% * 14,000 = Rs 1,680
Employers contribution towards the EPF = 3.67% * 14,000 = Rs 514
Employers contribution towards EPS = 8.33% * 14,000 = Rs 1,166.

The total contribution that is made by the employer and employee towards the EPF account of the employee = Rs 1,680 + Rs 514 = Rs 2,194.

You have the interest rate at 8.5% for FY 2020-21.

You can calculate the interest rate which is applicable for each month as:

8.5%/12 = 0.70833%

Assume the employee joined the Firm XYZ in April 2019. The total EPF contribution for April will be Rs 2,194. The EPF scheme will not pay any interest for April.

The total EPF contribution for the month of May = Rs 4,388. (Rs 2,194+ Rs 2,194). He gets an interest of Rs 4,388 * 0.70833% = 31.08.

The calculation is done similarly for the subsequent months.

## Benefits of EPF

For a salaried person, contributions to the EPF offer a lot of benefits:

- Safe returns
This is one of the safest debt instruments available in the country. It is government backed and guarantees safety of principal and interest earned. It can help you accumulate a significant corpus for your retirement, as the contributions happen month on month for your entire working life. This makes it suitable for very long term financial goals.

- Friendly tax treatment
This is an E-E-E instrument – meaning your contributions are deductible under Section 80C, interest earned is tax free and maturity proceeds are also tax free, provided contributions to the fund have been for more than 5 years of service.

- Interest earned on EPF is the equivalent of a high pre-tax rate
Considering that the EPF is paying 8.75% this year, this is the equivalent of a 12.50% rate of interest (for somebody in the 30% tax bracket). This interest rate is guaranteed and risk-free.
