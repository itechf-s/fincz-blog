{{< iframe "/pages/sip-calculator/">}}

## What is a EMI calculator?

A Personal Loan EMI calculator is a simple tool which calculates the EMI that you are required to pay every month for the repayment of your loan. 

All you need to do is enter the Loan Amount, Rate of Interest, and the desired Loan Tenure and the calculator will instantly calculate the EMI Amount and the Interest Payable. 

## Interest Rate Calculator

It has become common these days to purchase high-end electronic gadgets, furniture and household appliances (such as fridge, TV, washing machine etc.) using installment loans.

Manufacturers and sellers lure buyers with low EMI payments and buyers fall into the trap without understanding the interest rate for such loans. 

Given the loan amount (i.e., item price), EMI and tenure, this calculator helps you estimate the interest rate on such loans.


## How to Use a Personal Loan EMI Calculator?

A personal loan EMI calculator has the following three important components –

Loan Amount or Principal –It the total amount that a you borrow as loan and are required to pay back at the end of the term along with the interest

Rate of Interest – Expressed as a percentage, the rate of interest is the rate at which interest will be charged on the principal loan amount for a loan duration

Loan Tenure or Loan Duration – Expressed either in years or months, tenure is the time period within which you are liable to pay back the total personal loan amount with interest 

You can use our calculator to calculate your personal loan EMI. Just follow the steps mentioned below.

Step 1 – Using the first slider, set the desired Loan Amount. You can even use the ‘+’ and ‘-‘ symbols to increase or decrease the amount or enter the amount manually in the box

Step 2 – Use the second slider to set the Rate of Interest. You can use the ‘+’ and ‘-‘ symbols to increase or decrease the interest rate or manually enter it in the given box

Step 3 – The third and final slider will help you set the Loan Duration, in months or years. You can even use the ‘+’ or ‘-‘ symbols to increase or decrease the loan duration or you can manually enter the same in the box.

The personal loan EMI calculator will automatically show you the EMI amount that you need to pay every month. 

## How does a personal loan EMI calculator work?

An EMI calculator uses a simple mathematical formula to calculate your EMI. The formula used is:

- E = P*r*(1+r)^n/((1+r)^n-1) where

- E is EMIP is the principal loan amount,
  
- r is the rate of interest calculated every month, and

- n is the tenor/duration in months


## Why should I use an EMI calculator?

An EMI can be calculated using the formula EMI = P * (r*(1+r)^n)/((1+r)^n – 1). Or can be calculated in excel. Both the process is tedious and time taking. Hence, it is easier to use an EMI calculator. 

The user has to just enter the loan amount, tenure, and loan interest rate. The calculator calculates the EMI, the total amount payable, and the interest payable.

Users should opt for a Loan EMI calculator because it is simple to use and calculates tedious calculations within seconds.

## Can I use the same EMI calculator for home, car and personal loans?

All the above calculators work on common parameters and use the same EMI calculator formula to arrive at the final EMI amount payable. 

Hence one can use the same EMI calculator for calculating loan EMI. The only difference is that these parameters may be subject to a minimum and maximum restriction regarding the type of loan.

## Factors Affecting Loan 

Various factors affect the EMI of a loan. Short tenure loans are not affected by these factors, but the long tenure ones like the home loan are surely affected . This is mainly because house loans are linked to MCLR (Marginal Cost of Lending Rate), which keeps changing.
