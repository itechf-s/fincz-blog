{{< iframe "/pages/mutual-fund-returns-calculator/">}}

## What is a Mutual Fund Return calculator?

A Mutual Fund is a professionally managed investment scheme. It is run by an asset management company (AMC) which serves as a mediator for the retail investors. The AMC pools in money from a large number of investors and invests it in equity shares, bonds, money market instruments, and other types of securities.

## How does a mutual fund calculator help you?
- A mutual fund calculator provides you with the estimated returns for the investment tenure, be it 1-year, 3-years, etc.
  
- It is a free tool that is available to investors. It is quite convenient to use and even a layperson can use it with relative ease.


- A mutual fund calculator helps investors plan and manage their finances better once they have an estimated idea of the future value of their investments.


- It offers reasonably accurate returns on your mutual fund investments. However, one should note that as mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, one cannot predict the returns with pinpoint accuracy.

## The formula of calculating returns via mutual fund return calculator
SIP calculator
An SIP calculator works on the following formula:

FV = (P * ((returns / 100) / 12)) / (Math.pow((1 + ((returns / 100) / 12)), (year * 12)) - 1);

Here,

FV = Future value of the investment

P = SIP investment amount

Let’s understand this with the help of an example:

Megha wants to invest Rs1,000 per month for 12 months. The expected rate of interest on this investment is 12% pa (per annum). Thus, the future value of her investments (M) would be:

M = 1,000 X ({[1 + 12%]12 – 1} / 12%) x (1 + 12%)

Therefore, M = Rs25,293 (approx)

Instead of having to compute complex calculations, Megha can simply use a mutual fund return calculator to save time and effort.

N.B.: The rate of interest on an SIP investment will differ as per market conditions and may increase or decrease.

2. Lumpsum calculator
A lumpsum calculator works on the following formula:

A = P (1 + r/n) ^ nt

Here,

A = estimated returns

P = Present value of investment

r = estimated rate of return

t = tenure

n = number of compound interests in a year

Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

Sonia makes a lumpsum investment of Rs20 lakh in a mutual fund that offers average returns at the rate of 12% pa. The duration for her investment is 5 years that compounds every 6 months.

Here,

P = 20,00,000

r = 12/100

t = 5

n = 2

Therefore, the estimated future returns, in this case, would be:

A = 20,00,000 (1 + 12/100*2) ^ 2*5

A = Rs35,81,695 (approx)

Instead of having to make complex calculations, Sonia can simply use a lumpsum calculator to save time and effort.

## How is mutual fund return calculated?


FV = Future value or the amount you get at maturity. For example, you invest Rs 1,000 a month in a mutual fund scheme using the systematic investment plan or SIP route. The investment is for 10 years, with an estimated rate of return of 8% per year. You have i = r/100/12 = 8/100/12 = 0.006667.
