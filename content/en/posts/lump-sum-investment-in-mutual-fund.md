## What is Lumpsum Investment

A lumpsum investment is a method where an investment in a mutual fund is made in one go. They are usually made in great amounts, unlike SIPs which are small investment amounts at regular intervals.

She didn’t want to split the amount to be put in small investments at regular intervals, since she had surplus money lying idle in her bank account. As Priya is well aware of inflation risk, she decided to put all of it in one go.
