## What Is a Mutual Fund

A mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. 

Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors.

A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.


Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities.

Each shareholder, therefore, participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. 

Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund—derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.

### Most Important Disadvantages of Mutual Funds

### 1. Misuse of Management Authority

Some fund managers may unnecessarily churn the portfolio. Portfolio churning is constant buying and selling of stocks.

High portfolio churning increases taxes and other costs. This reduces portfolio returns. Constant churning can also result in your fund manager making poor investment decisions which can lead to substantial losses.

### 2. Exit Load

You have exit load as fees charged by AMCs when exiting a mutual fund. It discourages investors from redeeming investments for some time. It also helps the fund manager garner the required funds to purchase the appropriate securities at the right price and time.

### 2. Dilution

Due to dilution, it is not recommended to invest in too many Mutual Funds at the same time. Diversification, although saves an investor from major losses, also restricts one from making a higher profit.

### 3. High Sales Charges

There are no free lunches in this world. Similarly, mutual funds also come with costs in the form of expense ratios. Expense ratio covers fund management fees, marketing and sales costs etc.

A high expense ratio directly affects your portfolio returns. Investors who prefer a lower expense ratio can invest in ‘index funds’.

### 3. Mutual Funds Have Hidden Fees

If fees were hidden, those hidden fees would certainly be on the list of disadvantages of mutual funds. The hidden fees that are lamented are properly referred to as "12b-1 fees." 

While these fees are no fun to pay, they are not hidden. The fee is disclosed in the mutual fund prospectus and can be found on the mutual funds’ websites. Many mutual funds do not charge a 12b-1 fee.

If you find the 12b-1 fee onerous, invest in a mutual fund that does not charge the fee.
