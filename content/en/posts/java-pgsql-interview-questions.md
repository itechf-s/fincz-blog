4. **What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java?**
   - **Answer:** ArrayList is based on a dynamic array, while LinkedList is based on a doubly-linked list. ArrayList provides fast random access, LinkedList provides faster insertions and deletions.

5. **What is a lambda expression in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Lambda expressions are a feature in Java that allow us to write anonymous methods, providing a clear and concise way to implement single-method interfaces.

6. **Explain the term ‘Functional Interface’ in Java.**
   - **Answer:** A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method, and can thus be implemented using lambda expressions.

7. **What is the difference between ‘==’ and ‘equals()’ in Java?**
   - **Answer:** '==' checks for reference equality, whereas 'equals()' checks for value equality.

8. **What is a Java Stream?**
   - **Answer:** A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.

9. **What is a thread-safe collection in Java?**
   - **Answer:** Collections that are designed to be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads, e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`.

10. **What is a NullPointerException?**
    - **Answer:** It is a runtime exception thrown when an application attempts to use `null` in a case where an object is required.

### PostgreSQL Questions

12. **Explain the difference between a table and a view in PostgreSQL.**
    - **Answer:** A table stores data physically, while a view is a virtual table created by a query joining one or more tables.

14. **What are indexes and why are they used in PostgreSQL?**
    - **Answer:** Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine uses to speed up data retrieval.

16. **What is a primary key in PostgreSQL?**
    - **Answer:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table, ensuring that no duplicate values are present.

17. **What is a foreign key in PostgreSQL?**
    - **Answer:** A foreign key is a field that links one table to the primary key of another table, enforcing referential integrity.

18. **How do you handle transactions in PostgreSQL?**
    - **Answer:** Using the commands `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` to control the transaction flow.

### Full-Stack Development Questions

27. **What is a `transient` variable in Java?**
    - **Answer:** A `transient` variable is not serialized during the serialization process, meaning it will not be persisted.

28. **Explain method overloading and method overriding in Java.**
    - **Answer:** Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

29. **What is the `final` keyword used for in Java?**
