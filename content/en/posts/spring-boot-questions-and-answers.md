## Java Spring Boot:

### 1. What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing default configurations, dependency management, and production-ready features out of the box.

### 2. Explain the key features of Spring Boot.
- **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures application components based on classpath settings and dependencies.
- **Starter dependencies**: Spring Boot provides a set of curated dependencies that are commonly used together for specific functionalities.
- **Embedded server**: Spring Boot comes with an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) that eliminates the need for deploying applications to a separate server.
- **Actuator**: It provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring for applications.
- **Spring Boot CLI**: Spring Boot Command Line Interface allows rapid prototyping and development using Groovy scripts.

### 3. How does Spring Boot differ from the Spring Framework?
Spring Boot builds on top of the Spring Framework and aims to simplify the configuration and setup process. While the Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model, Spring Boot focuses on convention over configuration and provides auto-configuration for common scenarios.

### 4. Explain the concept of dependency injection in Spring Boot.
Dependency injection is a core concept in Spring Boot. It allows the application to define dependencies and let Spring manage their instantiation and injection. By using annotations like `@Autowired`, dependencies can be automatically wired into classes, making them more modular and easier to test.

### 5. How do you create a RESTful API using Spring Boot?
To create a RESTful API using Spring Boot, you typically follow these steps:
1. Define the API endpoints using the `@RestController` annotation.
2. Map the HTTP methods to specific methods in the controller using annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
3. Implement the business logic inside the controller methods.
4. Use appropriate annotations like `@RequestBody` and `@ResponseStatus` to handle request bodies and set response statuses.
5. Configure any required security, authentication, or authorization mechanisms.
