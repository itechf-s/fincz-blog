Top 11 Tips Indian Bridal Makeup Ideas
--------------------------------------

**Step 1:** **Wash Your Face**

![wash your face](https://img.bestrani.com/2021/05/wash-your-face.jpeg)

First, wash your face with good soap or face wash that your skin prefers most.

If you have dry skin, then moisturize your skin with lotion or moisturizing cream, making your skin soft and smooth.

On the other side, if you got oily and sleek skin, I suggest a good face wash like Himalaya Herbals.

**Step 2:** **Select Dress Color**

Dress color, type of makeup, color coordination according to your dress, variety of makeup your skin favors, trendy Indian makeup.

All of even these are important things that should be considered before beginning your makeup. Planning is important for things to run easily.

Now, if you have decided on your dress and find out that what’s best for you, then go to the next step.

**Step 3:** **Cleansing And Facials**

Do you know, cleansing and facials perform a great role in makeup. In Indian makeup, the artists ask their brides to come in some before their wedding day so that they can get a facial and cleansing of their face.

The most suitable cleansing milk for you are, Nivea Visage Refreshing, Himalaya deep cleansing, Nivea Aqua Effect.

Clarins with gentian, VLCC Skin Defense Sandal Cleansing milk, Clinique take the day off, fab India, Shi said Revital treatment cleansing milk, and Lotus Herbals Lemon.

Certain cleansing milk is very reasonable and considered the ten best cleansing bowls of milk. Cleansing will smoothen your skin, remove moisture, and preserves the elasticity of your skin.

Here I’m giving you the most reliable Indian facial kits, which you can easily purchase and get a glow on your face.

**Step 4: Apply the Primer**

![Use a Primer](https://img.bestrani.com/2021/05/Use-a-Primer.jpeg)

A primer can build a smooth, polished canvas on your skin to hold your makeup for a long time.

It blurs out the open pores, lightens blemishes, and continues an even tone.

Simply squeeze some primer on the back of your hand, mix it with your fingers and use as dots on your face and dab it well to get a blurry effect.

A primer should be used to the base for the makeup to stay for longer hours.

Start with applying the thin layer of primer on your face, neck, and hand skin. Blend completely for staying its long duration. If you have combination skin then it is an essential step.

Once the color correctors are blended well, you can now build a base by applying a foundation.

You can pick from double wear, liquid-based, cream-based, stick, or cushion foundation depending on the time and section of the event.

Apply a round brush or a wet sponge to gently build the product on your skin. Make sure there are no uneven spots near the forehead and jawline.
