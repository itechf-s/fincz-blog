How to Handle Ingrown Hair on the Face
--------------------------------------

### Wash your face daily

Washing your face with only water may not be sufficient to inhibit ingrown facial hair.

To avoid this problem, wash your face every day with mild soap to remove any dirt or oil that’s closing your pores.

This is necessary because clogged pores increase the risk of ingrown hairs.

If attainable, use cleansers that peel your skin. Rub your face in a round motion to remove dead skin cells.

If you’re swelling facial hair, use a warm compress to your face for some minutes before using the wax. This method opens your pores and inhibits ingrown hairs.

### Improve your shaving technique

Poor shaving methods further add to the risk of ingrown facial hair. Some people pull their skin-tight while shaving, but this often results in cutting the hair too short.

It’s more necessary to shave in the area of your hair to avoid cutting the beaches too short. If you notice facial hair flowing descending, shave in this direction.

### Clean your razor blade

Using the same razor blade above and above again also raises the risk of ingrown hairs. You should not only constantly change the blade in your razor but also wash your blade after each stroke.

A dirty blade can cause bacteria to get into your pores and cause an infection. Wash your blade with water behind each stroke, and use an alcohol-based cleaner later shaving.
