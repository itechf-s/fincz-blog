# Introduction (5 minutes)

* **Welcome and Context:** Hi everyone, thanks for joining! Today, I'm here to share some insights and tips to help you for your upcoming interviews with Itechf they are mostly using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL I recently interviewed and now working for itechf.

* First Question as usual you may be asked to give your introduction. After that, they will ask you about the previous project, your role and responsibilities in it, and what work you have done.

They can ask some questions about the work you have done in the previous project and whatever you will explain. And will put up questions one after the other from the same.

* **Brief Overview:** "Let's start with a quick introduction to most common technologies they are using. 
* Java is a versatile object-oriented programming language. 
* Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies Spring development, allowing us to create production-grade applications quickly. 
* PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and scalability.
* JavaScript for UI debugging might be they wont be asked any question but good to have basic JS knowledge

**Java Fundamentals (10 minutes)**

* **Core Concepts:** Prepare core Java concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP) principles (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation), data structures (arrays, lists, maps, sets), collections framework, exceptions handling, garbage collection, threading, and concurrency.

**Spring Boot Deep Dive (15 minutes)**

* **Key Features and Advantages:** Emphasize Spring Boot's auto configuration capabilities, convention over configuration approach, starter dependencies, and its role in simplifying Spring development compared to traditional Spring configuration.
* **Spring MVC and RESTful APIs:** Explain Spring MVC architecture for web applications and how it facilitates building RESTful APIs. Discuss annotations like `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@ResponseBody` for handling requests and responses.
* **Security:** Briefly touch upon Spring Security integration for authentication and authorization in Spring Boot applications.

**PostgreSQL Expertise (10 minutes)**

* **Relational Database Concepts:** Review relational database fundamentals like tables, columns, data types, primary and foreign keys (for data integrity), and SQL queries for data manipulation (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* **Core PostgreSQL Features:** Mention unique PostgreSQL features like advanced data types (JSON, arrays), stored procedures and functions for complex logic, triggers (automated actions on database events), and user management for access control.

Technologies I use daily (Java, Spring, Eclipse IDE, PostgreSQL, and browser developer tools) 

**Eclipse IDE:** Eclipse is their preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for development. 

**Inspect Element:** Debugging web applications using inspecting the Document Object Model (DOM), manipulating styles and scripts (CSS, JavaScript) to identify and fix frontend issues.

**End Note:**

Thanks for joining me today! I hope this session will be helpful for all of you.
All the very best for your interview. If you need any thing else please feel free to ping me.

# Sample check-in format (13 Apr 2025)

## What has gone well in the past quarter? (Compact Answer)

In the past quarter, I successfully worked on HCSA claims, OCS claims, Interface #12, #20 #25, and resolved multiple PBO-related issues. I was able to debug and resolve multiple client-reported issues, ensuring smoother claim finalization and data flow through the interfaces. My contributions helped in reducing the number of open Jira tickets and improving the overall claim processing performance.

## What has gone well in the past quarter?

In the past quarter, I have worked extensively on HCSA claim processing, as well as on Interface #12 and #20 OCS claims, and have supported PBO-related issue analysis and resolution. I was able to debug and resolve multiple client-reported issues, ensuring smoother claim finalization and data flow through the interfaces.

My contributions helped in reducing the number of open Jira tickets and improving the overall claim processing performance. I maintained regular communication with the onsite and functional teams, which helped in aligning deliverables with business expectations and timelines.

Additionally, my efforts in troubleshooting and RCA (Root Cause Analysis) contributed to minimizing recurring errors and enhancing the stability of the related modules.

## What could have been done better (Compact Version):

In the past quarter, I handled HCSA claims, OCS claims, Interface #12, #20 #25, and PBO-related tasks. While tasks were delivered on time, I feel I could improve by sharing regular updates with stakeholders and documenting solutions better. Moving forward, I plan to enhance my time management and contribute to internal knowledge sharing for better team collaboration.

## What could have been done better?

Over the past quarter, while I successfully handled multiple responsibilities including HCSA claims, OCS Interfaces (#12 and #20), and PBO-related issues, I feel there is room to enhance my proactive communication and knowledge documentation.

At times, juggling multiple high-priority tasks made it challenging to keep all stakeholders consistently updated, especially during overlapping issue resolutions. I also see an opportunity to contribute more actively in internal knowledge sharing, which could benefit the wider team in resolving recurring issues more efficiently.

Going forward, I aim to improve by structuring my time more effectively, maintaining detailed RCA logs, and sharing key learnings regularly with peers. This will not only enhance collaboration but also strengthen the team’s overall delivery efficiency.

## What actions have you taken to develop the skills identified against your goal? (Compact Answer)

To enhance my domain knowledge, I have regularly reviewed client documentation, analyzed previous tickets, and attended internal walkthrough sessions. I’ve also started maintaining solution notes for recurring issues and taken initiative in peer discussions to improve clarity and resolution time for different Interfaces, HCSA and OCS claim workflows.

## What actions have you taken to develop the skills identified against your goal?

To develop the skills aligned with my goals, I have taken several proactive steps over the last quarter. I have regularly referred to client-provided documentation to strengthen my domain understanding, especially around claims processing and interface behavior. I’ve also closely studied previously resolved tickets to recognize patterns and improve my troubleshooting approach.

In addition, I have participated in team walkthrough sessions to gain better insights into complex business flows like HCSA and OCS interfaces (#12 and #20). To support long-term knowledge retention and team collaboration, I started maintaining detailed solution notes for recurring issues.

Furthermore, I initiated peer discussions to clarify edge-case scenarios and enhance my resolution speed. These steps have helped me become more confident and accurate in handling client-critical tickets and will continue to support my professional growth.

## What kind of support do you need from company/team/manager to achieve the desired skill levels?

To achieve the desired skill levels, I would appreciate continued guidance and feedback from my manager on areas of improvement, especially around domain knowledge and interface-related scenarios. Regular knowledge-sharing sessions within the team can also help in gaining a broader understanding of complex issues.

If possible, access to structured internal training modules or client-specific technical documentation would further enhance my learning. Additionally, support in assigning me to more diverse and challenging tasks will help me build confidence and develop stronger problem-solving capabilities.

I am committed to learning and contributing effectively, and with the right mentorship and exposure, I believe I can grow further in my current role.
