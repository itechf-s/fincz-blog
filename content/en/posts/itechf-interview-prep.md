**Introduction (5 minutes)**

* **Welcome and Context:** Hi everyone, thanks for joining! Today, I'm here to share some insights and tips to help you for your upcomming interviews with Itechf they are mostly using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL I recently interviewed and now working for itechf.

* First Question as usual you may be asked to give your introduction. After that, they will ask you about the previous project, your role and responsibilities in it, and what work you have done.

They can ask some questions about the work you have done in the previous project and whatever you will explain. And will put up questions one after the other from the same.

* **Brief Overview:** "Let's start with a quick introduction to most common technologies they are using. 
* Java is a versatile object-oriented programming language. 
* Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies Spring development, allowing us to create production-grade applications quickly. 
* PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and scalability.
* JavaScript for UI debugging might be they wont be asked any question but good to have basic JS knowdlege

**Java Fundamentals (10 minutes)**

* **Core Concepts:** Prepare core Java concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP) principles (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation), data structures (arrays, lists, maps, sets), collections framework, exceptions handling, garbage collection, threading, and concurrency.

**Spring Boot Deep Dive (15 minutes)**

* **Key Features and Advantages:** Emphasize Spring Boot's autoconfiguration capabilities, convention over configuration approach, starter dependencies, and its role in simplifying Spring development compared to traditional Spring configuration.
* **Spring MVC and RESTful APIs:** Explain Spring MVC architecture for web applications and how it facilitates building RESTful APIs. Discuss annotations like `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@ResponseBody` for handling requests and responses.
* **Security:** Briefly touch upon Spring Security integration for authentication and authorization in Spring Boot applications.

**PostgreSQL Expertise (10 minutes)**

* **Relational Database Concepts:** Review relational database fundamentals like tables, columns, data types, primary and foreign keys (for data integrity), and SQL queries for data manipulation (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* **Core PostgreSQL Features:** Mention unique PostgreSQL features like advanced data types (JSON, arrays), stored procedures and functions for complex logic, triggers (automated actions on database events), and user management for access control.

Technologies I use daily (Java, Spring, Eclipse IDE, PostgreSQL, and browser developer tools) 

**Eclipse IDE:** Eclipse is their preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for development. 

**Inspect Element:** Debugging web applications using inspecting the Document Object Model (DOM), manipulating styles and scripts (CSS, JavaScript) to identify and fix frontend issues.

**End Note:**

Thanks for joining me today! I hope this session will be helpful for all of you.
