### Share Market

A share market is a market in which shares of a particular company are purchased and sold. The stock market is a definite example of a share market.

### Short selling

When an investor wants to earn money in a bear market, then he does short selling.

This can be done by putting a sell position at a given market price (say $100) and then if the price fall (say $80), then he buys that share.

By doing this way he can have a profit of $20 and that share as well. This is generally done when an investor feels that price of a particular stock is expected to fall in the future.

When a company issues shares, each share has a face value. This refers to the value of the stock at the time of issuance. The company that issues the stock decides the face value and it does not change over time. And in case you hear someone say par value instead of face value, don’t panic. Both terms mean the same thing.
