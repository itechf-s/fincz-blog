## what is share
If there is any part of anything, out of any big thing, then a part of it is called share. Now let's talk about when we buy shares of a company from the stock market, suppose a company had 100 shares and we bought 2 shares, then we will be called share holders of 2% of that company.

## Why company needs shares
Now let's talk about why the company needs shares, in this way shares are needed, suppose if there is a company, it makes something similar or sells it somewhere else, then in this way the company There is benefit.

Let us understand with an example that when a company makes a product, raw material is needed for it, an employee is required to prepare that raw material and when the product is ready, it sells it in the market. It takes time

If the money does not come immediately, then the company has to manage its expenses such as buying raw material or paying salary to the employer, or the company has other expenses, all these expenses require a lot of money. When the company operates on a small scale, it needs less money.

But as the company gets bigger then its expenses also increase and after selling the product which has been made in the market, it takes a long time to get money to meet all these needs. To meet these needs, the company has 2 options, one option is to go to the bank and take a loan and manage the expenses of the company with the loan money.

The second option is that they divide their company into small parts and make shares so that any common person can invest their money in it, in this way money comes to the company and the company benefits. has made people its sharers as its share, other people who have taken part.

They will also make profit. When the company will profit by investing money, those who have bought the shares will also profit, in this way the company needs the shares, in this way both the company and the common man benefit.

## In what way and where does the share start
Now let's talk about how and from where the stock starts, when any company reaches from small level to big level, then it brings its IPO and gets the IPO listed in the stock market. Is. First of all the company brings its IPO which is also called Initial Public Offering.

There is a price decision of an IPO, there is a debt decision, at that price, sometimes it happens that the company has brought all the IPO shares and people have applied more means more people want. If we get IPO then in that case it is implemented randomly through automatic system.

Who will get or who will not get it, let us understand with an example, suppose that more people applied than the IPO that the company brought, then not everyone will get it and if the IPO brings more then everyone will get the IP. Through .o the company comes with its offer at the first time.

Then the company gets listed in the stock market, after that anyone can buy and sell their shares. To bring the IPO, the company has to show its documents, there are some things that the company has to follow. SEBI Securities and Exchange Board of India has been created to control the stock market, which is the regulator of the entire stock market.

SEBI sees that if something is going wrong, the company is not telling things properly or hiding some things about the company and inflating its profit to take money because the higher the profit of the company will be.

In the same way, more and more people would like to buy the shares of that company because they will earn profit only when the company earns more money, in this way SEBI has an important role in the stock market, SEBI only keeps an eye on the company as well as on the investor. It keeps an eye on whether it is doing anything wrong, if something wrong is happening somewhere, SEBI takes action on it.

## What is stock exchange

What happens in the Sensex is that whatever companies are listed in BSE, which is a stock exchange, according to the market pack, the 30 largest companies, all of them together form a group, that is called Sensex. The Sensex was started in 1986 and its base point was kept at 100, currently the base point is running around 55 thousand, so you can see how much the Sensex has increased since 1986.

Now let's talk about NSE exchange in Nifty of Nifty, the 50 largest company listed in it means the market capital which is the highest, in that order a list of 50 big companies is prepared, that list is sometimes called Nifty 50 We also say that by this we also get to know that what is the condition of our stock market, is it going up or going down.
