Thereafter, choose the frequency of the interest pay-out. For monthly and quarterly pay-outs, reinvestment, the duration has to be entered in days, months or years. The short term duration can be between 1-31 days.

## How is FD Interest Calculated?

There are two methods of calculation of interest on a fixed deposit, viz. Simple Interest and Compound Interest.

## What is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is the interest earned on an investment at a pre-decided rate of interest for a specific period of time. It is calculated by multiplying the principal amount, the rate of interest per annum and the time for which the money is lent in years.

**Simple Interest Formula:**

SI = P x R x T/ 100

Where,

SI = Simple Interest

P = Principal (amount invested)

R = Rate of Interest (in %)

T = Tenure (time for which deposit is kept in FD account)

For example, if a sum of Rs 10,000 is invested for 3 years at 10% interest rate per annum, then at the time of maturity,

SI = 10,000*10*3/100 = Rs 3,000

**Maturity Amount **= Rs 13,000

## What is Compound Interest?

Compound interest is the interest earned on principal as well as interests. It is calculated by multiplying the principal amount with the interest rate raised to the number of periods in years for which the interest will be compounded.

Formula for Compound Interest:

A = P (1+r/n) ^ (n * t)

Where,

A = Maturity Amount

P = Principal amount

r = Rate of Interest (in decimals)

n = number of compounding in a year

t = number of years

For example, if a sum of Rs 10,000 is invested for 3 years at 10% compound interest rate (quarterly compounding), then at the time of maturity,

A= 10,000 {1 + (0.1/4)} ^ (4 * 3)

A = 10,000 (1 + 0.025) ^ (12)

A = 10,000 (1.025) ^ (12) = Rs. 13,449 (approximately)

Compound Interest (CI) Earned over 3 years = Maturity Amount – Principal Amount

CI = 13,449 – 10,000 = Rs. 3,449
