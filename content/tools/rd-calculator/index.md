## What is a RD calculator?
RD or Recurring Deposits are an investment tool which allows investors to make regular monthly payments and save money for the long term. Investors can choose the tenure of the deposit and the minimum monthly payment they wish to make according to their convenience. 


## How to use it

The maturity value of the deposit will depend on the amount of investment, duration of the deposit and the interest rate.

You will have to enter the date of opening of the FDRD, and then enter the amount of deposit which has to between Rs 500 and Rs 10 lakh. Thereafter, the duration has to be entered in months which have to be between 6 months and 120 months.

Lastly, enter the annual rate of interest at which the recurring deposit investment has been made.

One can use the slider to put in different recurring deposit amounts to arrive at the final maturity value.

## How is RD interest calculated?

Interest on RD is compounded quarterly, in most banks. The formula for this is :

M = R[(1+i)^n-1]/(1-(1+i)^(-1/3) )

In this,

M = Maturity Value

R = Monthly Installment

n = Number of quarters

I = Rate of interest/400

So, if you invest in RD and put in Rs. 5,000 per month for a year, at the interest rate of 8%, your total value will be calculated as:

R = 5000
n = 4 (one year has four quarters)
I = 8.00/400

M = Rs. 62, 647 in one year

## How is RD interest calculated?

The formula used is A = P(1+r/n) ^ nt, where 'A' represents final amount procured, 'P' represents principal, 'r' represents annual interest rate, 'n' represents the number of times that interest has been compounded, 't' represents the tenure.

## Can I deposit extra money in RD?

Unlike Fixed Deposit, you can deposit a fixed sum with your Bank or Post Office for a pre-defined term every month.It is important to remember that, once you start an RD account, the deposit amount and term cannot be altered.

## Who Can Invest in Recurring Deposits?

Investing in a recurring deposit is a viable option for those who currently do not have a big amount of money but are looking for a low-risk investment option where higher returns can be earned with regular deposits.

All Indian residents and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) are eligible to open a Recurring Deposit with their bank. Some banks also allow minors to open an RD so that the habit of saving is inculcated in them since childhood.

However, minors should have guardians to supervise their finances. Most of the banks ask their customers to set an amount in multiples of 100.
