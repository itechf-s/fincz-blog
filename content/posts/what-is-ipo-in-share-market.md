## what is ipo in share market

An IPO is an initial public offering. In an IPO, a privately owned company lists its shares on a stock exchange, making them available for purchase by the general public.

In other words, IPO is the selling of securities to the public in the primary market.  A primary market deals with new securities being issued for the first time. 
 
After listing on the stock exchange, the company becomes a publicly-traded company and the shares of the firm can be traded freely in the open market.

Many people think of IPOs as big money-making opportunities—high-profile companies grab headlines with huge share price gains when they go public.

But while they’re undeniably trendy, you need to understand that IPOs are very risky investments, delivering inconsistent returns over the longer term.

## Types of IPO 

There are two types of IPOs. They are dependent upon the type of price generation the company or the underwriter is going for. These are of two types:
 
### Fixed Price Offering(IPO)

In Fixed Price Offering, the company decides on the price of the stocks initially, and any buyer or investor pays that amount per share to obtain the desired number of stocks.

The demand for the stocks in the market can be known once the issue is closed. If the investors partake in this IPO, they must ensure that they pay the full price of the shares when making the application.

### Book Building Offering (IPO)

In Book Building IPO, the company decides the price band of the forthcoming IPO. The interested investors bid on the shares before the final price is decided.

Here, the investors need to specify the number of shares they intend to buy and the amount they are willing to pay per share.

The lowest share price is referred to as floor price and the highest stock price is known as cap price. The ultimate decision regarding the price of the shares is determined by investors’ bids.
