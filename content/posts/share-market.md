## How can shares be bought and sold
By now you have learned how to buy and sell shares. Now we know how to buy and sell shares, in which some popular methods are used by people, three of them are talking here.

Apart from this, there can be other ways as well.

The first method that people use is intraday trading, after that the second method is swing trading and the third method is long term investment. Let us know about these 3 methods.

### Intraday Trading - Intraday Trading
What happens in intraday trading is that the timing of the market is from 9:15 am to 3:30 am, during that time any trader or whoever participates in the stock market buys shares and sells on the same day. So it is called intraday trading.

This intraday trading is the most risky and the most money is lost in this if no one is aware of it properly. So a lot of money is wasted, no skill is required in intraday trading, intraday trading works on Luck.

It happens in intraday trading that any person buys a share on the same day and sells it on the same day, either the price of the share will increase or the price of the share will decrease, either he gains or he loses.

In most intraday trading, there is only loss, in this we also get margin money, which can increase the loss further. The broker from whom we have opened our demat account also gives us some margin money, meaning like we have invested ₹ 100 in intraday trading.

The broker gives us some percentage on his behalf, suppose you have ₹ 100 and the broker gives you ₹ 900 more and says buy shares from it and then sell the profit and return the margin money in the evening.

When the stock trader borrows ₹ 900, it is a kind of borrowing and he buys 1000 shares, suppose the price of one share becomes ₹ 90, according to ₹ 10, there is a loss of ₹ 100 in your 10 shares, in the same way if you Profit happens.

Suppose the price of a share becomes ₹ 110, then you got a profit of ₹ 100, that means earlier you had ₹ 100 and you have profited ₹ 100, so in 1 day the money has doubled to ₹ 100 i.e. you have ₹ 200 It's done, it's a profit.

If you assume that according to 90, the price of 10 shares is ₹ 900, accordingly you have lost ₹ 100, your Luck works in intraday trading, some day you will profit and some day you will lose Intraday trading is the most risky it occurs.

Even if you make profit in the beginning days but in the end you have to make a loss.

### Swing Trading - Swing Trading
In swing trading, it happens that we buy shares and seeing its moment whether the stock is increasing or will increase and at the time when the price of the share has increased according to us, then we sell the shares. Swing trading is a bit less risky than intraday trading.

There are also ricks in swing trading, thinking that you buy shares in a week or 10 days or a month, if the price of the share increases, then you will sell the stock.

### Long Term Investment - Long Term Investment
![Long Term investment](images/2021/08/share-price.png)
This is what happens in long term investment, we buy the shares of the company once and hold the shares for a long time until we are short of money or see something wrong in the company (meaning when we bought the shares, the company The performance of the company was good and now the performance of the company is not good) then we do not sell the shares.

The most money earns in long term investment in the stock market, the reason is that in long term investment, your stock does not matter when the market fluctuates, which is a good company, it stays in profit in long tram.

So in the long tram, you get the benefit of the increase in the price of the company and the profit of a good company, they also give some percentage of the profit in the form of dividend, which will give you double benefit. Long term investment is the best investment but it has a lot of profit. It takes time, some people have to earn money quickly, that's why people do not like long term investment.

### Trading Vs Investment which is better
In trading, you know that if you want to earn money quickly, then you will earn it quickly, if you are greedy after that, then you can also witness the money, it is not so in long term investment, there is very little greed in it.

Where greed is less, then it will slowly but you will get benefit in the long run, those who are beginners do not know anything about it, they should not touch the trading part at all, it would be better for them to do long term investment only.

The share is stored in the demat account itself and kept there, the share comes in the demat account only when we have bought the share for at least 3 days for the long term, if we do intraday then our share will not come in the demat account. When we have bought our shares, then we take delivery of it, that means we do not sell them on the same day.
