### Akhirat's Investment

This is the best investment in investment. Finally, that is, the investment after death, in which we hope that by helping someone with some money or by serving him or removing some of his troubles, we hope that we will get its reward.

Expecting this reward is only one way of investment, if we do not expect reward then no one will help anyone with our money or anything else when we help with the intention of reward then it is an investment.

When no coin will work in the future, then the coin of goodness will work, at that time we will remember this thing in all our investments that I wish we had not made any other investment in the world except Akhirat when nothing would work at that time.

That's why we all need to do something for ourselves that will be useful after death.

### Investment In Agriculture

Farming is also an investment in which the farmer puts the seed in the ground so that later on that seed will produce many more flowers, if the farmer does not expect that some fruit will come out of this seed.

He will not invest by putting that seed in the ground, he does so in the hope that by putting this seed in the soil, he will get many fruits and flowers, which will benefit him.

### Investment In Education

In this, we tell our children to read and write from childhood and want them to succeed by reading and writing.
Even after taking any kind of trouble, parents teach their children in the hope that they will be successful by studying and writing, which will benefit them, so this is also a way of investment.

### Investment In Bank

Investment in the bank is generally considered to be a very popular and easy investment in which people make FD in the bank but it is the worst investment, in which only the bank benefits.

And the one who is doing FD in the bank does not get any benefit because the inflation has increased more than the returns in the bank, but if he does not calculate so much, then he does not even know and he keeps on doing FD in the bank.

And we are not getting any return on his money, we never recommend this investment because firstly there is no benefit to the person doing it, secondly there is also a matter of interest interest which we should not do, so just know it here. That one should not make FD in the bank.

## Why Should You Invest

As we have discussed above, what are the types of investment. From that you must have understood that whether to invest or not, it also happens automatically. If we invest consciously, then we will get the benefit of it, otherwise the investment will be done unknowingly.

It is a folly to not invest consciously, which will have to bear the consequences if not today or tomorrow. 

For example, if a child did not study well in his childhood, then later he has to bear the loss everywhere.

Similarly, if a farmer did not put a good seed in the ground and or did not put a good seed but after that he did not take care of it, then he would not get anything except his hard work wasted, so as we understand all these things in the same way. We should also understand investment.

## Investment Is Right Or Wrong

Although investment is a very good thing and a very important thing, but just like any thing overdose does harm, in the same way if we put everything in our investment, then it will also do harm for us.

Like if we have 100 rupees and we invest all the money, then we will eat, should we invest our savings money in investment, just try that we can save as much as possible.

For example, as a farmer saves some seed from the crop produced by him, that it has to be put in the ground again next time, he does not do that, put all the seeds in the ground as much as it has been, it would be foolish to do this.

Similarly, we should invest only our savings in investment and try to save as much as possible after fulfilling our needs.

An advantage of investing is that you will also be able to avoid extravagance. When you learn to invest, you will not spend extravagantly, but by investing the same money or your time, you will be able to take more advantage of it.

## Benefits of Investing

Any person does any work when his benefit is clearly visible to him, if the benefit is not clear to him, then he is unable to do the work, so here we are telling you some benefits of investment so that the matter is understood properly.

There are many benefits of investing as we have already mentioned. Now let's talk about some more benefits.
