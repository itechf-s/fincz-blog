## RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Questions and Short Answers

### 1. What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on the HTTP protocol and emphasizes stateless, client-server communication through standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### 2. What is a RESTful web service?

A RESTful web service is an implementation of the REST architecture that allows clients to interact with resources over the web using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It follows the principles of statelessness, uniform resource identification, and representation.

### 3. How can you create a RESTful web service in Spring Boot?

In Spring Boot, you can create a RESTful web service by annotating a class with `@RestController` and defining methods that handle HTTP requests using annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. Spring Boot automatically handles the serialization/deserialization of objects to/from JSON/XML.

### 4. What is the purpose of the `@RestController` annotation?

The `@RestController` annotation is used to annotate a class in Spring Boot that will handle incoming HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses. It combines the `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations, making it convenient for building RESTful web services.

### 5. What is the difference between `@RequestMapping` and `@GetMapping`?

`@RequestMapping` is a general annotation used to map HTTP requests to methods in a controller. It allows you to specify the request URL, HTTP method, and other parameters. `@GetMapping` is a specialized version of `@RequestMapping` for handling GET requests specifically.

### 6. How can you pass data in the URL path in a RESTful web service?

You can pass data in the URL path of a RESTful web service by using path variables. Annotate a method parameter with `@PathVariable` and provide the corresponding variable name in the URL mapping. Spring Boot will bind the value from the URL to the parameter.

### 7. How can you pass data in the request body in a RESTful web service?

To pass data in the request body of a RESTful web service, use the `@RequestBody` annotation on a method parameter. Spring Boot automatically deserializes the request body content (e.g., JSON) into the specified parameter type.

### 8. What is the purpose of the `@PostMapping` annotation?

The `@PostMapping` annotation is used to handle HTTP POST requests in a RESTful web service. It maps the specified URL to the annotated method, allowing you to process incoming POST requests.

### 9. How can you return JSON responses from a RESTful web service in Spring Boot?

To return JSON responses from a RESTful web service in Spring Boot, annotate the method with `@ResponseBody` and return a Java object. Spring Boot will automatically serialize the object to JSON.

### 10. What is the purpose of the `@RequestBody` annotation?

The `@RequestBody` annotation is used to bind the HTTP request body to a method parameter in a RESTful web service. It allows you to receive and process data sent by the client in the request body.

### 11. How can you handle query parameters in a RESTful web service?

To handle query parameters in a RESTful web service, annotate a method parameter with `@RequestParam`. The value of the query parameter will be automatically bound to the annotated parameter.

### 12. What is the purpose of the `@PutMapping` annotation?

The `@PutMapping` annotation is used to handle HTTP PUT requests in a RESTful web service. It maps the specified URL to the annotated method, allowing you to process incoming PUT requests.

### 13. How can you handle HTTP DELETE requests in a RESTful web service?

To handle HTTP DELETE requests in a RESTful web service, use the `@DeleteMapping` annotation. It maps the specified URL to the annotated method, allowing you to process incoming DELETE requests.

### 14. What is HATEOAS in the context of RESTful web services?

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a principle of RESTful web services that involves including hypermedia links in the API responses. These links allow clients to discover and navigate the available resources and actions dynamically.

### 15. How can you enable HATEOAS in a Spring Boot RESTful web service?

In Spring Boot, you can enable HATEOAS support by adding the `spring-boot-starter-hateoas` dependency to your project. It provides classes and annotations for building hypermedia-driven RESTful web services.

### 16. What is content negotiation in RESTful web services?

Content negotiation in RESTful web services involves determining the format of the response based on the client's preferences. The client can specify the desired content type (e.g., JSON, XML) using the `Accept` header in the HTTP request.

### 17. How can you enable content negotiation in a Spring Boot RESTful web service?

Content negotiation can be enabled in a Spring Boot RESTful web service by configuring the `ContentNegotiationConfigurer` in a `@Configuration` class. You can specify the supported media types and their associated serializers/deserializers.

### 18. What is the purpose of the `@ResponseStatus` annotation?

The `@ResponseStatus` annotation is used to specify the HTTP response status code for a method in a RESTful web service. It allows you to customize the response status code based on the outcome of the method execution.

### 19. How can you handle exceptions in a Spring Boot RESTful web service?

To handle exceptions in a Spring Boot RESTful web service, you can annotate a method with `@ExceptionHandler` and specify the exception type it should handle. You can then return a custom error response or perform any other necessary actions.
