**Hint:** Use `int[] arr = new int[5];`

---

### 2. Write a program to calculate the **sum and average** of values stored in an integer array.

```java
int[] marks = {90, 80, 70, 85, 95};
```

---

### 3. Write a program to **find the maximum** and **minimum** value from an array.

---

### 4. Write a program to **count the number of even and odd numbers** in an integer array.

---

### 5. Write a program to **traverse and print a 2D array** (matrix of 3x3 elements).

```java
int[][] mat = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
