&lt;h3 id="1-what-are-the-main-advantages-of-using-microservices-architecture">1. What are the main advantages of using microservices architecture?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Microservices architecture provides benefits such as improved scalability, fault isolation, independent deployment, technology diversity, and better team autonomy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-how-do-microservices-communicate-with-each-other">2. How do microservices communicate with each other?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Microservices typically communicate through lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST or messaging systems like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. API gateways and service registries can also be used for service discovery and communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-what-is-service-discovery-and-why-is-it-important-in-microservices">3. What is service discovery and why is it important in microservices?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Service discovery is the process of dynamically locating and registering services within a microservices architecture. It enables automatic service registration, health checks, load balancing, and allows services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coded dependencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RESTful Web Service Questions and Answers</title><link>/restful-web-service-questions-and-answers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 08:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/restful-web-service-questions-and-answers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="restful-web-service-with-spring-boot-questions-and-short-answers">RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Questions and Short Answers&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="1-what-is-rest">1. What is REST?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on the HTTP protocol and emphasizes stateless, client-server communication through standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-what-is-a-restful-web-service">2. What is a RESTful web service?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A RESTful web service is an implementation of the REST architecture that allows clients to interact with resources over the web using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It follows the principles of statelessness, uniform resource identification, and representation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spring Boot Questions and Answers</title><link>/spring-boot-questions-and-answers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 08:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/spring-boot-questions-and-answers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="spring-boot">Spring Boot:&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="1-what-is-spring-boot">1. What is Spring Boot?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Spring Boot is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing default configurations, dependency management, and production-ready features out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-explain-the-key-features-of-spring-boot">2. Explain the key features of Spring Boot.&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Auto-configuration&lt;/strong>: Spring Boot automatically configures application components based on classpath settings and dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Starter dependencies&lt;/strong>: Spring Boot provides a set of curated dependencies that are commonly used together for specific functionalities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Embedded server&lt;/strong>: Spring Boot comes with an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) that eliminates the need for deploying applications to a separate server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Actuator&lt;/strong>: It provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring for applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Spring Boot CLI&lt;/strong>: Spring Boot Command Line Interface allows rapid prototyping and development using Groovy scripts.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-how-does-spring-boot-differ-from-the-spring-framework">3. How does Spring Boot differ from the Spring Framework?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Spring Boot builds on top of the Spring Framework and aims to simplify the configuration and setup process.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
